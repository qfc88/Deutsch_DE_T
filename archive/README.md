# Archive Directory

This directory contains legacy scripts and utilities that are no longer actively used but kept for reference.

## Current Active Scripts (Root Directory)
- `run_2am_tonight.sh` - Simple Ubuntu 2 AM scheduler
- `test_2am_now.sh` - Immediate test runner

## Archived Scripts (old_scripts/)
- `setup_ubuntu.sh` - Complex Ubuntu auto-setup
- `install_systemd.sh` - Systemd service installer
- `start_scheduler.*` - Previous scheduler versions
- `run_2am_tonight*.py` - Python-based schedulers
- Various Windows `.bat` files

## Why Archived?
The project was simplified to focus on the core Ubuntu server use case with minimal dependencies and maximum reliability.

**Use the scripts in root directory for current operations.**
